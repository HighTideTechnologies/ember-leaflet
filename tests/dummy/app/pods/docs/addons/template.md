# Addons

Just as Leaflet has many plugins, ember-leaflet also does. The community created ember addons that extend ember-leaflet
functionality, usually using some Leaflet plugin under the hood. A list of those addons can be found
in the {{#docs-link "addons"}}addons page{{/docs-link}}.

As an example, let's take `ember-leaflet-marker-cluster` addon.

```bash
ember install ember-leaflet-marker-cluster
```
